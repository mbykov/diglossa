  <h4>how to create a book:</h4>

  <p>Three ways:

  <p>1 - the simplest - create a book in any spreadsheet editor such as MS-Excel or Libre-Office, in two or more parallel columns. Save it as .ODS file. And open the resulting file here.
  </p>

  <p>2 - the main one - create a directory tree of any degree of complexity. And in each sub-directory put any number of files with parallel texts, each of which in this sub-directory has the same number of paragraphs.
  </p>

  <p>(1,2 - for each book you can add a simple info.json file with a description of the book  and the authors of the texts).
  </p>

  <p>3 - the best - clone the book already created by someone, make corrections, additions and improvements, and publish the result. (The author of the original version will be able to reject your corrections if he does not like them)
