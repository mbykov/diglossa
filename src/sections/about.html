    This simple program is similar to the well-known FB-Reader program, but for parallel texts. With its help, you can quickly create a book with parallel texts, full-text search and the ability to generate a local dictionary, intergation with Morpheus (if any for your language). And publish the book on the web and source of the texts on a http://github.com with one click.

    The publication of source of the texts on the githab is needed for not creating multiple variants of the text, but to make corrections and additions to already existing text. Knowledge of the principles of Github is not required, it is enough to execute the "clone" and "publish" commands.
