#### About Morpheus for Ancient Greek:

- Morpheus is a desktop web application for Windows, MacOS, Linux. Works offline, synchronizes dictionaries when online. It is a free software (license is **GNU GPL**)
- instantly displays and analyzes any amount of text (just copy **Ctrl-C** Ancient Greek text anywhere on a desktop)
- uses a data from <span class="external" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=Category:Ancient_Greek_language">https://wiktionary.org</span> for creating the paradigms and the tests, so has several hundred thousand tests
- many other dictionaries (including LSJ) can be installed from <span class="external" href="http://diglossa.org:5984/_utils/#">http://diglossa.org:5984/_utils/#</span> (login: **guest**, password: **guest**) or from CSV files
- It recursively creates chains of segments, and then selects the best from them. So it analyzes the parts of the compound Greek word (just **click** on a wordform), so allows in-depth analysis - prefixes, suffixes, words with several stems, etc. **Disclamer**: the reverse side of this power - if there is no obvious correct result, Morpheus can find a chain of segments that is formally correct, but do not make sense as a whole
- user can easily create a local dictionary for a selected text, created in a seconds by his own hands. Just type **Ctrl-D** and add the translation for the desired word
- Morpheus integrated with <span class="external" href="http://diglossa.org/diglossa.js">Diglossa.js</span> (v >= 0.6), so user can find the translations of a word in question just with **Ctrl-F**.
