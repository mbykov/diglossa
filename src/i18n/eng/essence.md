## essence

**diglossa** is a slow reading tool.

### purposes

diglossa is an application for a) **reading** and b) **editing the structure** of .dgl ebooks.

- A dgl package can have both a single book text and several **parallel texts**.
- any reader can add a parallel translation himself/herself at any time
- it is possible to use **autosync** to synchronize parallel texts
- on the basis of multilingual **.dgl-packages** (parallel books) it is possible to generate **.dgl-dictionaries**, i.e. full-text search results for all words of the text. With the possibility of **context search**, i.e. searching for several word forms at once
- From a set of **.dgl-dictionaries** you can generate thematic contextual multilingual dictionaries (**cmd**). **cmd** - selection of phrases on a particular topic together with their parallel translations from all available .dgl dictionaries

### methods

The **diglossa** application does not use any linguistics and does not make or use any assumptions about so-called "language theory". Only honest comparison and transformation of strings is used. If you imagine the current trend of automatic translation systems and artificial intelligence, and turn it mentally to the exact opposite, the result will be a reference to **diglossa**.

for those who do not want, or cannot rely on automatic translation methods

### linguistics and hermeneutics

the purpose of **diglossa** is not to learn the language, but to understand the author of the text, i.e. to talk to the author.
